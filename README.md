The link to course: <a href="https://www.coursera.org/specializations/python" target="_blank">Python For Everybody.</a> 
This course gives us a brief intro to the python language and what actually is programming. The specialization consists of 5 courses but I have completed only first 2 courses as I am enough with that much knowledge to move on to other parts of the Python.
